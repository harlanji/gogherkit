An attempt to build a beautiful Cucumber/JBehave like tool for GoLang.

Sofar it is using the PEG parser/generator here: https://github.com/pointlander/peg

To get it running yourself, you must install that package to that 'peg' is in your $PATH.

If your Go environment is setup correctly, it should be a matter of running "go get github.com/pointlander/peg".
